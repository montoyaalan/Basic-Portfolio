      <p>My name is Alan Montoya and I joined this world in 1992. I'm an aspiring web developer who is hoping to make a career in the tech field.</p>

      <p>I have an undergrad in Mass Communications and Advertising from Texas State University. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through The University of Texas at Austin because I am looking for a more practical career.   </p>

      <p>I so far have wanted to cry every day after I leave class because just when I begin to understand something a whole new curve ball comes my way. It's funny to read this sentence now because I'm now in week 7 and have found the perfect balance 
        and remedy to survive this bootcamp. </p>
