      <p>My name is Alan Montoya and I was born in 1992. The rumors are true, I'm an Aries and I'm stubborn as hell.</p>

      <p>I have an undergrad in Mass Communications and Advertising from Texas State University. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through The University of Texas at Austin because I am looking for a more practical career.   </p>

      <p>I so far have wanted to cry every day after I leave class because just when I begin to understand something a whole new curve ball comes my way. </p>
